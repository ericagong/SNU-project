      "content": "If you haven't used state management excessively in React Function Components, this tutorial may help you to get a better understanding of how React Hooks -- such as useState, useReducer, and useContext -- can be used in combination for impressive state management in React applications. In this tutorial, we will almost reach the point where these hooks mimic sophisticated state management libraries like Redux for globally managed state. Let's dive into the application which we will implement together step by step."

      "title": "From Redux to Hooks: A Case Study",
      "content": "Having a single store in Redux comes with benefits, but at the same time you end up putting everything into global namespace. Most applications profit from this, you can even create nested reducers and use naming conventions for actions. But if your global state is small and you know for sure that specific slices of state will only be used by specific areas of your application, making them global makes you feel.. uneasy."

      "title": "Application State Management with React",
      "content": "One of the reasons redux was so successful was the fact that react-redux solved the prop drilling problem. The fact that you could share data across different parts of your tree by simply passing your component into some magical connect function was wonderful. Its use of reducers/action creators/etc. is great too, but I'm convinced that the ubiquity of redux is because it solved the prop drilling pain point for developers."
